The Swedish share of the payload has been made available to students from other European countries through a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). EuroLaunch, a cooperation between the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) and the Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA) of DLR, is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch vehicles. Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM and ESA provide technical support to the student teams throughout the project. REXUS and BEXUS are launched from SSC, Esrange Space Center in northern Sweden. The REXUS rocket enables teams from different universities to conduct innovative experiments in weightlessness and under extreme atmospheric conditions.\nThe participating teams have the challenge of integrating their scientific investigations into a compact experimental module that is placed on board a REXUS rocket. These rockets will be launched from the Esrange Space Center in Sweden. The competition is aimed at students of engineering, physics, astronomy and related disciplines.\nProjects are selected through a rigorous selection process that evaluates creativity, technical feasibility and scientific relevance. The selected teams are given the opportunity to test their experiments as part of a real space mission.\nThe REXUS/BEXUS competition not only promotes interdisciplinary collaboration between students, but also provides a practical insight into space research. The knowledge gained not only contributes to scientific progress, but also enriches the personal and professional development of the participating students.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPatch of REXUS/BEXUS\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPatch of WOBBLE2"

We received very good feedback but also some suggestions for improvement. In addition to the review, there was an intensive lecture program on all relevant topics of the campaign. It was exciting to get so much condensed knowledge from experts and to ask all your questions. At the same time, the program also promoted team building. All in all, it was a very special time and we are very much looking forward to coming back to Esrange in 13 months. Special thanks again to the friends of the TU Berlin.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe student research project MAGGIE is investigating the robotic removal of space debris using gecko inspired adhesive materials in microgravity. The aim is to demonstrate the functionality of the robotic arm and to test the interaction of gecko inspired adhesive materials with a smooth surface as fused silica in microgravity and space environment. The arm, equipped with a gecko inspired adhesive endeffector, should be able to manipulate or repair uncooperative space objects from a CubeSat platform. Through interaction, repairs and on-orbit servicing as well as orbit manipulation can be carried out, making space travel significantly more sustainable. When conducting the experiment during a launch on a REXUS sounding rocket, the robotic arm will navigate to targets in a microgravity and space environment. The adhesive force of the gecko inspired adhesive materials on the surface is measured and the position of the material on the surface is recorded using cameras. The robotic arm itself consists of seven identical links in order to achieve redundancy of the individual joints."

    "text": "About the Project\nThe primary objective of DOPAMINS is to detect the annihilation of positron-electron in the stratosphere using a detector mounted on a high-altitude balloon. A positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron. When high-energy cosmic rays hit the atmosphere, they create secondary particles, including antiparticles, through processes like pair production.\nWhen matter and antimatter meet, they annihilate. Some positrons annihilate immediately, and some survive a bit longer. When a positron meets an electron, they annihilate and release two gamma rays of 511 keV, emitted in opposite directions (about 180°).\nDOPAMINS aims to design an accurate and precise detection system to measure these events. This mission helps us understand the flux of positrons in the regions crossed by the balloon, and the detection system can be used as a basis for future antiparticle detection missions in space."

The balloon reaches about 30 km altitude, allowing students to test scientific instruments and space-related technologies in near-space conditions. The program is run by DLR, SNSA, and ESA, and gives students hands-on experience with real aerospace missions.\nThe REXUS/BEXUS programme is realised under a bilateral Agency Agreement between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Swedish National Space Agency (SNSA). The Swedish share of the payload has been made available to students from other European countries through a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). EuroLaunch, a cooperation between the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) and the Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA) of DLR, is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch vehicles. Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM and ESA provide technical support to the student teams throughout the project. REXUS and BEXUS are launched from SSC, Esrange Space Center in northern Sweden."

Development started in the summer of 2022 with manufacturing beginning in 2023, leading up to the launch in September 2024.\nTo acquire a motor powerful enough for to reach the target height, we drove to the Netherlands to buy an M-class motor. Almost all systems have been upgraded or completely redesigned to sustain the higher maximum speed of 0.56 Ma and the associated vibrations. Our fins have been manufactured from metal while the nose cone was created using only glass fiber. The electronics compartment used the same flight computers as STARMOON in combination with an updated arming system. Outward-facing cameras were also included. We have also developed a GPS downlink system to track our rocket. The redesigned recovery system used 2-stage recovery, with the nose cone blasting off at apogee to reveal the drogue chute while the main chute opens at 300 m by cutting a steel cable.\nAs payload, we had the WOBBLE experiment on board. This consisted of a camera pointed at a 3D-printed tank (PMD = propellant management device) for small satellites, allowing observation of the fluid behavior inside.\nThe rocket was launched in the Netherlands in cooperation with DARE in September 2024.\n\n\n\nStardust rocket\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats\n\n\n\n\n\nAltitude\n1547 m\n\n\nMass\n18 kg\n\n\nTotal Impulse\n6.3 kNs\n\n\nVelocity\n0.56 Ma\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStardust patch"
