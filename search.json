The Swedish share of the payload has been made available to students from other European countries through a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). EuroLaunch, a cooperation between the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) and the Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA) of DLR, is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch vehicles. Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM and ESA provide technical support to the student teams throughout the project. REXUS and BEXUS are launched from SSC, Esrange Space Center in northern Sweden. The REXUS rocket enables teams from different universities to conduct innovative experiments in weightlessness and under extreme atmospheric conditions.\nThe participating teams have the challenge of integrating their scientific investigations into a compact experimental module that is placed on board a REXUS rocket. These rockets will be launched from the Esrange Space Center in Sweden. The competition is aimed at students of engineering, physics, astronomy and related disciplines.\nProjects are selected through a rigorous selection process that evaluates creativity, technical feasibility and scientific relevance. The selected teams are given the opportunity to test their experiments as part of a real space mission.\nThe REXUS/BEXUS competition not only promotes interdisciplinary collaboration between students, but also provides a practical insight into space research. The knowledge gained not only contributes to scientific progress, but also enriches the personal and professional development of the participating students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPatch of REXUS/BEXUS\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nPatch of WOBBLE2"

    "text": "We started with our first rocket STARMOON in a newly created module at the TUB in October 2021. Quickly we figured with the university that we should found a student club for further developing this and other projects. Starting with six people we had the ambitious goal to launch a rocket with a target apogee of 600 m, so we could launch in Germany, while having already a motor with 500 N thrust. During half a year we gained knowledge about rocketry and started with the design of our compartments. We learned many things about 3D printing, flight computer control, machining, fiber composites, motors, redundant recovery systems and so on. In early summer we had a functional rocket. The rocket was launched as a full success and with a complete recovery one year later in October 2022 near Brunswick with the student club ERIG.\n\n\n\nStarmoon rocket\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats\n\n\n\n\n\nAltitude\n600 m\n\n\nMass\n12 kg\n\n\nTotal Impulse\n1,4 kNs\n\n\nVelocity\n0,3 MA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarmoon patch\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nStarmoon team"

    "text": "STARDUST is our second rocket development. With a target apogee of 3 km and a length of 2,5 m a very powerful rocket for our young team. Development started in summer 2022 and manufacturing in 2023. For such powerful motors we drove to the Netherlands to buy them, in this case we use a M class motor. With higher speed of about 1 Ma and therefore vibrations we upgraded or completely changed almost all systems. Our fins are made from metal and our nose cone completely from glass fiber. Electronics system is using the same flight computers while updating the arming system as well as adding some cameras. We also developed a GPS system to track our rocket. The recovery system got more complex now with a 2-stage recovery. The nose cone blasts off revealing the drogue chute, while the main chute is opened at 300 m with cutting a steel cable. We also have the experiment WOBBLE on board, which is a 3D printed tank for propellant management in small satellites.\n\n\n\nStardust rocket\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStats\n\n\n\n\n\nAltitude\n3000 m\n\n\nMass\n18 kg\n\n\nTotal Impulse\n6,3 kNs\n\n\nVelocity\n1 MA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStardust patch"

This project is especially suitable for beginners and we are looking forward to your participation."
