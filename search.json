Our club was founded on the 31th of May 2022 with the goal to provide students from all the discplines the opportunity to apply their theoretical knwoledege in practical space related projects.\nIn addition to the space projects, which you can find under projects here, we also do joint activities. We attend trade fairs and congresses together. Below you will find a small photo overview of latest joint activities.\n\n&lt; &gt;"

    "text": "&lt; &gt;   \n\n\n\n\nOur projects are split up in three work groups:\n\nThe Experimental Rocketry group currently develops multiple rockets. These rockets are built based on solid-propellant engines. A bi-propellant engine and a test environment are in progress. The goal is to merge the work on rockets and on bi-propellant engines in the future.\nThe Science and Experiments group develops and operates science experiments and payloads. Furthermore, it develops, designs and builds satellite components and systems.\nIn the Robotics group, robotic systems are designed, built, tested and operated. Currently, the group is focused on robotic implementation of in situ resource utilization technologies for various space environments. One of the projects in this area is the development of a mobile solar smelter which heats up the regolith on the surface of the moon to melting temperatures using sunlight. The goal is to create a sealed surface which can benefit various lunar construction ambitions like building roads or foundations.\n\nRegardless of your academic background, if you are interested you can contact us via mail or on Instagram. Otherwise, you can join us in our weekly meeting Tuesdays at 6 pm in the F11 at the ILR."

Quickly we figured with the university that we should found a student club for further developing this and other projects. Starting with six people we had the ambitious goal to launch a rocket with a target apogee of 600 m, so we could launch in Germany, while having already a motor with 500 N thrust. During half a year we gained knowledge about rocketry and started with the design of our compartments. We learned many things about 3D printing, flight computer control, machining, fiber composites, motors, redundant recovery systems and so on. In early summer we had a functional rocket. The rocket was launched as a full success and with a complete recovery one year later in October 2022 near Brunswick with the student club ERIG.\n\n Starmoon patch\n\n\n Starmoon team"

The program enables teams from different universities to conduct innovative experiments in weightlessness and under extreme atmospheric conditions.\nThe participating teams have the challenge of integrating their scientific investigations into a compact experimental module that is placed on board a REXUS rocket. These rockets will be launched from the Esrange Space Center in Sweden. The competition is aimed at students of engineering, physics, astronomy and related disciplines.\nProjects are selected through a rigorous selection process that evaluates creativity, technical feasibility and scientific relevance. The selected teams are given the opportunity to test their experiments as part of a real space mission.\nThe REXUS competition not only promotes interdisciplinary collaboration between students, but also provides a practical insight into space research. The knowledge gained not only contributes to scientific progress, but also enriches the personal and professional development of the participating students.\n\n Patch of REXUS/BEXUS\n\n\n Patch of WOBBLE2"

It is a great opportunity to further push ourselves to develop better and bigger rockets. We started the development in October 2023. Our goal is to fulfil the requirements of the competition as well as to develop many new aspects of our rocket. The structure shall be for the first time made from carbon fiber.

For such powerful motors we drove to the Netherlands to buy them, in this case we use a M class motor. With higher speed of about 1 Ma and therefore vibrations we upgraded or completely changed almost all systems. Our fins are made from metal and our nose cone completely from glass fiber. Electronics system is using the same flight computers while updating the arming system as well as adding some cameras. We also developed a GPS system to track our rocket. The recovery system got more complex now with a 2-stage recovery. The nose cone blasts off revealing the drogue chute, while the main chute is opened at 300 m with cutting a steel cable.
