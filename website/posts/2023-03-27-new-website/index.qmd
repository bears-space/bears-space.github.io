This is the new website for BEARS. More Blog posts will follow soon...

If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please contact us or open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/bears-space/website/issues).
<!-- 
## What's new?

- New design
- Blog posts
- Scientific writing with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

### Example of what you can do

This is the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation:^[more info on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation)]

$$\Delta v = v_e \ln\frac{m_0}{m_f}$$

For the upper stage of starship, the $\Delta v$ over the payload mass is:

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

mf = 1200  # fuel mass in t
ms = 120  # dry mass in t
mp = np.linspace(0, 150)  # payload mass in t
m0 = mf + ms + mp  # total mass in t
ve = 3560  # exhaust velocity in m/s
dv = ve * np.log(m0 / (ms + mp))  # delta v in m/s

plt.plot(mp, dv)
plt.ylabel("$\Delta v$ [m/s]")
plt.xlabel("Payload mass [t]")
plt.show()
``` -->
