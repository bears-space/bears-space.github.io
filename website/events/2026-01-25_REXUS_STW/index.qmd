MAGGIE and DOPAMINS are going to Esrange


With the successfull acceptance to the REXUS/BEXUS programm, both the MAGGIE and the DOPAMINS team were invited to the REXUS/BEXUS Student Training Week and the Preliminary Design Review (PDR) at Esrange (Kiruna/Sweden). This took place from 26 to 30 January 2026 up in the far and vast north of Sweden at the rocket launch facility Esrange. 

The teams presented there the current design of their experiments, and met other european teams, project ideas and students. With a great scenery and auroras, esrange is not just a launch site for sounding rockets and balloons, but also a very nice place to stay for some days and enjoy lectures and team building events.

With the submission of the first student experiment description of both teams a huge milestone was celebrated in advance of the Training Week.
