MAGGIE goes to Esrange


With the successfull acceptance to the REXUS/BEXUS programm, the MAGGIE team was invited to the REXUS Student Training Week and the Preliminary Design Review at Esrange (Kiruna/Sweden). This will take place from 26 to 30 January up in the far and vast north of Sweden. 

We are excited to present there on our experiments developments, but also see and meet other european teams, project ideas and students. We can also look forward to unique natural scenery and great chances of seeing the magnificent Northern Lights.
