The experimental rocketry team develops and builds rockets. We have already completed two launches. 

## Our rockets
Our first rocket was [STARMOON](https://www.bears-space.de/projects/Starmoon/), which launched in 2022. We improved on that rocket with our second rocket [STARDUST](https://www.bears-space.de/projects/Stardust/) which launched in 2024. Unlike our first rocket, this one was carrying an experiment. Our third flagship rocket, which is currently in production, is [STARGAZE](https://www.bears-space.de/projects/Stargaze/). It is scheduled to be launched in October 2025. A fourth rocket, called MOONDUST, is also under development.

## Our team
Our team consists of 24 highly motivated students from several different degrees (including Geotechnology). We try to push ourselves harder every time we develop a new rocket to make a more advanced rocket. We are also very interested in participating in competitions.
