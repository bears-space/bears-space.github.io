## Our rockets
Our current rocket, ready for launch, is [STARDUST](https://www.bears-space.de/projects/Stardust/).
Our first rocket was [STARMOON](https://www.bears-space.de/projects/Starmoon/).
Our next rocket will be [STARGAZE](https://www.bears-space.de/projects/Stargaze/).

## Our team
In the rocket systems group we build our own rockets. 
We have already achieved a successful launch to an altitude of 600m. 
Currently we are building a rocket that is designed to reach an altitude of 3 km. 
On this also a small experiment is to be accomplished. 
We also want to participate in competitions with the new rocket.
