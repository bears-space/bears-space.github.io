Lars (Lunar Astronaut Revival System) was a cardiac massage device designed to revive astronauts in their spacesuits. 
With our prototype we participated in the [Asclepios--Mission 2](https://asclepios.ch/de/asclepios-ii-5/). For this, a small team went to Lausanne. 
For 2023/24 we plan to participate in the competition again. 
This project is especially suitable for beginners and we are looking forward to your participation.
