STARGAZE is our third rocket. As we grew in our team member size and our experience with already quite powerful rockets, we decided our next step is to further push ourselves to develop better and bigger rockets. 
We started the development in October 2023. Our goal is to develop many new aspects of our rocket. The structure shall be for the first time made from carbon fiber. 
We develop our own flight computer, a battery management system as well as our own payload, a spin camera system. Our stats for the rocket and interesting pictures will follow with our progress. Stay tuned!
