WOBBLE2 stands for **W**eightless **O**bservation of **B**ehaviour with **B**erlin **L**iquid guided **E**xperiment. 
We are planing to test new propellant management devices (PMD) for satellite tanks. We want to use additive manufacturing techniques as well as develop new PMD designs that are only possible with the new manufacturing technology. 
During the microgravity phase in the REXUS-Rocket the Fluid will be observed with a camera. The liquid is pumped to simulate different fill levels and dynamic movements.

## News

**03.06.24**: The tickets are booked and we travel to Oberpfaffenhofen to the CDR. From 10.-13.06. we will meet the other REXUS teams and present our experiment concept.


## The Team
A motivated team has been formed for the 15th cycle of [REXUS/BEXUS (ESA-website)](https://www.esa.int/Education/Rexus_Bexus/About_REXUS_BEXUS) competition. 
The application was submitted on October 9th and we got selected at the 13.12. 
We are 11 enthusiastic students covering all areas from electrical design to flow simulation. If you want to contact us to join the team or you have any other request, contact us with wooble2@bears-space.de.
Six of us took part in the workshop in Kiruna from 05.-09.02.2024. 
This time, an experiment on new 3D printed tanks is to be carried out.

## The Propellant Managment Devices
In the experiment we will test 6 different PMDs in small tanks. For the fluid we will use normal water combined with Uranin. 
Probably we will add some antifreeze against the low temperatures in Sweden.
In the slide show below you can see first 3D-printed prototypes filled with Uranin to test the observation capabilities of our camera.

## About the REXUS competition

The [REXUS/BEXUS programme](https://rexusbexus.net/) is realised under a bilateral Agency Agreement between the 
German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Swedish National Space Agency (SNSA). The 
Swedish share of the payload has been made available to students from other European 
countries through a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA). EuroLaunch, a 
cooperation between the Swedish Space Corporation (SSC) and the Mobile Rocket Base 
(MORABA) of DLR, is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch 
vehicles. Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM and ESA provide technical support to the student 
teams throughout the project. REXUS and BEXUS are launched from SSC, Esrange Space 
Center in northern Sweden.
The REXUS rocket enables teams from different universities to conduct innovative experiments in weightlessness and under extreme atmospheric conditions.

The participating teams have the challenge of integrating their scientific investigations into a compact experimental module that is placed on board a REXUS rocket. These rockets will be launched from the Esrange Space Center in Sweden. 
The competition is aimed at students of engineering, physics, astronomy and related disciplines.

Projects are selected through a rigorous selection process that evaluates creativity, technical feasibility and scientific relevance. 
The selected teams are given the opportunity to test their experiments as part of a real space mission.

The REXUS/BEXUS competition not only promotes interdisciplinary collaboration between students, but also provides a practical insight into space research. 
The knowledge gained not only contributes to scientific progress, but also enriches the personal and professional development of the participating students.

## Trainingweek in Esrange
To evaluate the preliminary design, theBexus and RExus teams from all countries met in Esrange in the north of Sweden. 
There, each team presented its ideas to a jury consisting of representatives from ESA, DLR, SNSA, ZARM from Bremen and MORABA. 
We received very good feedback but also some suggestions for improvement. 
In addition to the review, there was an intensive lecture program on all relevant topics of the campaign. 
It was exciting to get so much condensed knowledge from experts and to ask all your questions. 
At the same time, the program also promoted team building. 
All in all, it was a very special time and we are very much looking forward to coming back to Esrange in 13 months. 
Special thanks again to the friends of the TU Berlin. 
Thanks to their financial support we were able to travel to Sweden as a group of six instead of four.

## Old News

**14.02.24**: We had an incredibly great time during the training week in Sweden. We got a lot of input and good feedback. Now it's time to order the first components and test them diligently. The next milestone is the critical design review on June 10 in Oberpfaffenhofen.

**04.02.24**: We have received our first press statement from the TU Berlin. You can read it [here](https://www.tu.berlin/ueber-die-tu-berlin/profil/pressemitteilungen-nachrichten/tu-studenten-fliegen-fuer-tests-ihres-raumfahrt-experiments-nach-schweden).

**24.01.24**: The team will fly to Kiruna at 4.-11.02 with 6 members. We would like to thank our friends at TU Berlin for making it possible for us to take two more team members with us to Kiruna.

**15.01.24**: We are currently looking for motivated students to support us in our outreach program. If you are intrested in managing our Instagram and organize exhibition stands, please contact us on Instagram via bears.space.
