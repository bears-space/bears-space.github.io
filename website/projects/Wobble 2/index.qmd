**News: Our team got invited to present the WOBBLE2 idea in Bonn. On the 27.-28.11 three of us will present the experiment idea in front of a jury of the DLR. The results will be published on 18.12.**

## The Team
A motivated team has been formed for DLR's 15th [Rexus](https://www.esa.int/Education/Rexus_Bexus/About_REXUS_BEXUS) competition. 
This time, an experiment on new 3D printed tanks is to be carried out. 
The application was submitted on October 9 and we are currently preparing for the selection workshop. 
We are 8 enthusiastic students covering all areas from electrical design to flow simulation.

## Experiment Idea
WOBBLE2 stands for **W**eightless **O**bservation of **B**ehaviour with **B**erlin **L**iquid Guidance **E**xperiment. 
We are planing to test new propellant management devices (PMD) for satellite tanks. We want to use additive manufacturing techniques as well as develop new PMD designs that are only possible with the new manufacturing technology. 
During the microgravity phase in the REXUS-Rocket the Fluid will be observed with a camera. The liquid is pumped to simulate different fill levels and dynamic movements.

### The Propellant Managment devices
In the experiment we will test 8 different PMDs in small Tanks. For the fluid we will use normal water combined with Uranin. 
In the slide show below you can see first 3D-Printed Prototypes filled with Uranin to test the observation capabilities of our camera.
