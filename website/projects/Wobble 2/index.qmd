**News (13.12): Our team got selected for the REXUS Program.**

**Workforce: We are currently looking for motivated students to support us in our outreach program. If you are intrested in managing our Instagram and organize exhibition stands, please contact us on Instagram via bears.space.**

## The Team
A motivated team has been formed for DLR's 15th [Rexus (ESA-website)](https://www.esa.int/Education/Rexus_Bexus/About_REXUS_BEXUS) competition. 
The application was submitted on October 9th and we got selected at the 13.12. 
We are 8 enthusiastic students covering all areas from electrical design to flow simulation. 
At least four of us will take part in the workshop in Kiruna from 05-09.02.2024. 
This time, an experiment on new 3D printed tanks is to be carried out.

## Experiment Idea
WOBBLE2 stands for **W**eightless **O**bservation of **B**ehaviour with **B**erlin **L**iquid Guidance **E**xperiment. 
We are planing to test new propellant management devices (PMD) for satellite tanks. We want to use additive manufacturing techniques as well as develop new PMD designs that are only possible with the new manufacturing technology. 
During the microgravity phase in the REXUS-Rocket the Fluid will be observed with a camera. The liquid is pumped to simulate different fill levels and dynamic movements.

## The Propellant Managment Devices
In the experiment we will test 8 different PMDs in small tanks. For the fluid we will use normal water combined with Uranin. 
In the slide show below you can see first 3D-printed prototypes filled with Uranin to test the observation capabilities of our camera.

## About the REXUS competition

The [Rexus](https://rexusbexus.net/) (Rocket Experiments for University Students) competition, initiated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR), offers students the unique opportunity to send their experiments into space on board sounding rockets. 
The program enables teams from different universities to conduct innovative experiments in weightlessness and under extreme atmospheric conditions.

The participating teams have the challenge of integrating their scientific investigations into a compact experimental module that is placed on board a REXUS rocket. These rockets will be launched from the Esrange Space Center in Sweden. 
The competition is aimed at students of engineering, physics, astronomy and related disciplines.

Projects are selected through a rigorous selection process that evaluates creativity, technical feasibility and scientific relevance. 
The selected teams are given the opportunity to test their experiments as part of a real space mission.

The REXUS competition not only promotes interdisciplinary collaboration between students, but also provides a practical insight into space research. 
The knowledge gained not only contributes to scientific progress, but also enriches the personal and professional development of the participating students.
