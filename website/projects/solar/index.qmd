In the SOLAR group, we are working on a system with which lunar regolith simulant (Moon dust) can be melted. The main component is a Fresnel lens that concentrates the sunlight. 
The goal of this is to build dust free areas in the future on the Moon utilizing the resources in-situ.
Initial tests have successfully created small areas. Now, we are in the process of further developing the first prototype and testing different melting methods.
