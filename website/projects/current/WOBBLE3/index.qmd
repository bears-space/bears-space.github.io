## News

**23.12.2025**: WOBBLE3 received to invitation letter to the selection workshop at the ESTEC in the Netherlands. We are looking forward an inspiring dialogue and exchange with the experts from ESA as well as meeting the other student teams.

## Abstract

WOBBLE3 is observing and comparing the performance of additively manufactured propellent management devices (PMD) traps with porous elements, in a micro-g environment. Porous elements traps stop gas transport through the pores but allow liquid transport if the pressure is below the so-called bubble point pressure. This is applied to keep the outlet of a propellent-tank gas-free in micro-g which is critical for a safe combustion process. WOBBLE3 uses the additive process to implement microstructures into the trap to enhance the effectiveness of the PMD, which has not been studied before to the knowledge of WOBBLE3. The effectiveness will be determined by four key values: flow rate, pressure loss, gas free outlet, and wetting rate. These key values are determined on ground as a reference and in-situ during the micro-g environment using a camera, pressure sensors, and a flow sensor. The trap will be places in a water fluid loop, and a pump will transport the fluid to the test area. Three traps are tested: a conventional manufactured perforated sheet; an additive manufactured perforated sheet with the same dimensions; and a perforated sheet with microstructures. WOBBLE3 expects that the perforated sheets without microstructures perform like each other regarding the listed key values, while the perforated sheet with microstructures is expected to perform better. WOBBLE3 is a follow-up to [WOBBLE2](/projects/past/Wobble%202/) which determines that additively manufactured PMDs are possible to manufacture and are usable in a near-space environment in micro-g.
