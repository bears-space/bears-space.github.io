We work together with the international students from the [Master of Space Engineering](https://www.mse.tu-berlin.de/) to build a Mars rover for the [European Rover Challenge](https://roverchallenge.eu/) (ERC).

## ERC24

During the ERC 2024 in Krakow we achieved **7th place** (of 27) and won the **best Navigation (Droning)** and **best Science (Geological Exploration)** awards!

## ERC23

In September 2023, we had a lot of fun participating in ERC (onsite) for the second time, reaching the 12th place (of 25). Based on the gained experience, we were redesigning our rover to climb the leaderboard in 2024.
