Of course, we are also involved in building rovers. In September 2023, we participated in the [European Rover Competition](https://roverchallenge.eu/en/main-page/) in Poland for the 2nd time. 
Thereby we reached the 12th place. In rover building, we work together with the international students from the [Master of Space Engineering](https://www.mse.tu-berlin.de/).
