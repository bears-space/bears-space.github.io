# BEARS Website

This is the source code for the [website](https://www.bears-space.de/) of BEARS, the *Berlin Experimental Astronautics Research Student Team*, based at [TU Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/).

The website is hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and build using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).

## Changing something

To add or change website content, locate the corresponsing `.qmd` file inside the [`website`](website/) folder and edit it. The content is specified using markdown - for more info, check out the [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

To add a new project site, create a new folder inside [`website/projects`](website/projects/) and then create an `index.qmd` file inside. You can also add extra files like images to the newly created folder. A good way to get started is simply copying an existing project site and modifying it.
